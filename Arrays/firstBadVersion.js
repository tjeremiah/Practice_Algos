//Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first 
//bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
//You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is
//bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number 
//of calls to the API.
